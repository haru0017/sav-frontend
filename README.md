## What is Sav ?

[Sav](https://spotify-artwork-app.vercel.app/) is spotify artwork viewer inspired by itunes artwork screensaver. 

Since it is a web app, it works on any device, but it is currently optimized for 1920 * 1080 displays. Therefore, I recommend viewing this web app on your computer, not your smartphone.

## Get started

You can get started by opening a [web page](https://spotify-artwork-app.vercel.app/), entering a playlist link in the text box and pressing the getplaylistimages button. 

Playlist links can be easily obtained from playlist sharing operations such as the spotify app. If you press button without link, global top 50 playlists will show. An example is the image below

## Future

- Improves image transition animation.

- Optimizes for different screen ratios and resolutions, such as smartphones and wide displays.

- Change the default playlist depending on the language.
